  <i><b>NOTE</b>: I took this as a 30 day challenge and I am glad I was able to see till the end. It was fascinating and a great learning experience for me. I am now discontinuing this effort to pursue a couple of other ideas. Stay tuned!</i></p>

“To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature ... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in. She offers her information only in one form; we are not so un-humble as to demand that she change before we pay any attention ” - [Richard Feynman](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/scivis/education/java/kluk/1/feynman.html)

A friend jokingly asked me if calculus is indeed used in everyday life beyond 12th-grade exams. This got me thinking, and as a personal endeavor to make mathematics fun and approachable, I am consolidating a list where mathematics gives more insight. The objective is to make people appreciate the use of mathematics in seemingly random applications in their everyday lives. 

### GROUND RULES:

1. I will be referencing documents that are freely available online that anyone without institutional access/subscription can download and read. The credit goes to the brilliant scientists/authors of the journal/article/publication. I do **NOT** claim any credit for their work. The point is to make the reader appreciate the beauty of maths by pointing to their work. References follow and links in [] brackets. 
2. I will not be making an effort to explain the complexities of the equations but rather show how mathematics is used in everyday applications. There could be conflicting works in the same domain, but I will make an effort to point to the seminal work in the area. References and citations can be tracked for latest developments in that area. 

So let's make mathematics fun?

Phyllotaxis is the arrangement of leaves in a stem of a plant. It turns out that there is a mathematical model to recreate the pattern called the DC2 equation but with certain assumptions causing the model to fail for different plant types. The modified version of the equation has now been determined that is more general for all plant types.

What is so unique about the following jokes?

`What is the difference between a pretty glove and a silent cat? - One is a cute mitten, the other is a mute kitten.`

`What do you call a strange market?- A bizarre bazaar`

These punning riddles were created by a computer program called JAPE, and are a part of computational humour. This field uses mathematics, linguistics and AI to computationally model a sense of humour.

Geometry and Origami (the art of paper folding) go hand-in-hand and is known to have applications in a variety of real-world problems. For example, the folding of paper can be used to determine the roots of a cubic equation. There is also an interesting connection between the art and an Indian Mathematician, T. Sundara Row (or Rao). He published *Geometric exercises in Paper Folding* in 1893, and is considered to be "*one of the main engines of the popularization of folding as a mathematical activity*" according to mathamatical historian Michael Friendman. 

The book according to T. S. Rao was ".*.sought not only to aid the teaching of geometry in schools and colleges, but also to afford mathematical recreation to young and old, in an at- tractive and cheap form. "Old boys" like myself may find the book useful to revive their old lessons, and to have a peep into modern developments which, although very interesting and instructive, have been ignored by university teachers.*"

It is known that the wave equation, a class of partial differential equations, is one of the widely used equations to describe systems whose solutions are "wave" like, and is best used to study the vibration in a string, e.g. the plucking of a guitar string. 

But do you know that the mathematical modelling of vibrating string led to a major controversy between d'Alembert,  Euler and Daniel Bernouilli, beginning in 1750 and lasting 80 years until Fourier and Dirchilet provided a solution?
