Hi, I am Nitin, a PhD student in [Department of Aerospace Engineering](http://aero.iisc.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in) (IISc), Bengaluru advised by [Prof. D. Roy Mahapatra](http://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/d-roy-mahapatra/), where I am a part of his [Integrative Multiscale Engineering of Materials and Systems (iMEMS) Group](https://imemslab.azurewebsites.net/). 

I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering](www.svce.ac.in) and Masters in Electrical Engineering from [University of Southern California](www.usc.edu) in 2009 and 2011, respectively. For my high-school education, I went to [SBOA School and Junior College](http://www.sboajc.org/) in Chennai. Needless to say, I grew up in cosmopolitan 'Singara' Chennai - 'Singaram' meaning 'beautiful' in the local language [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language).

I am an avid animal lover and an adoption advocate. I was a founding member of the Animal Welfare Group (AWG) at IISc where we initiated and started a students run volunteers group of more than 80 students that advocates coexistence of campus residents with animals and minimize human-animal conflicts. The group works in close coordination with the administration of IISc for vaccination and well-being of stray animals, rescue and rehablitation.

My former volunteering activities include being an English Tutor for underpreviledged students in non English medium school as part of the IISc Notebook Drive, IISc (2014-2015) and being a Volunteer at [Charlieâ€™s Animal Rescue Centre (CARE)](https://charlies-care.com), Bangalore (2017).

During my free time, I like to pick up a book and read (personally, I prefer non-fictional ones) or go cycling.  I am currently interested in the [physics of photography](https://sites.google.com/site/marclevoylectures/) and I am trying to pick up a thing or two about the art of making short movies.
