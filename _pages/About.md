Hi, I am Nitin, a PhD student in [Department of Aerospace Engineering](http://aero.iisc.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in) (IISc), Bengaluru advised by Prof. D. Roy Mahapatra, where I am a part of his [Integrative Multiscale Engineering of Materials and Systems (iMEMS) Group](https://imemslab.azurewebsites.net/). I started my PhD work from July 2014.

I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering](www.svce.ac.in) and Masters in Electrical Engineering from [University of Southern California](www.usc.edu) in 2009 and 2011, respectively. For my high-school education, I went to [SBOA School and Junior College](http://www.sboajc.org/) in Chennai. Needless to say, I grew up in cosmopolitan 'Singara' Chennai - 'Singaram' meaning 'beautiful' in the local language [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language).

During my free time, I like to pick up a book and read (personally, I prefer non-fictional ones) or go cycling or travel around. I am currently interested in the physics of photography and I am trying to pick up a thing or two about the art of making short movies. 

I am an avid animal lover and an adoption advocate.
