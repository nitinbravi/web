<p>Hi, I am Nitin, a PhD student in <a href="http://aero.iisc.ac.in">Department of Aerospace Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), Bengaluru advised by <a href="http://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/d-roy-mahapatra/">Prof. D. Roy Mahapatra</a>, where I am a part of his <a href="https://imemslab.azurewebsites.net/">Integrative Multiscale Engineering of Materials and Systems (iMEMS) Group</a>.</p>

<p>I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from <a href="www.svce.ac.in">Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering</a> and Masters in Electrical Engineering from <a href="www.usc.edu">University of Southern California</a> in 2009 and 2011, respectively. For my high-school education, I went to <a href="http://www.sboajc.org/">SBOA School and Junior College</a> in Chennai. Needless to say, I grew up in cosmopolitan ‘Singara’ Chennai - ‘Singaram’ meaning ‘beautiful’ in the local language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language">Tamil</a>.</p>

<p>I am an avid animal lover and an adoption advocate. I was a founding member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/iisc-awg">Animal Welfare Group (AWG) at IISc</a> where we initiated and started a students run volunteers group of more than 80 students that advocates coexistence of campus residents with animals and minimize human-animal conflicts. The group works in close coordination with the administration of IISc for vaccination and well-being of stray animals, rescue and rehablitation.</p>

<p>My former volunteering activities include being an English Tutor for students in a non English medium school as part of the IISc Notebook Drive (2014-2015) and being a Volunteer at <a href="https://charlies-care.com">Charlie’s Animal Rescue Centre (CARE)</a>, Bangalore (2017).</p>

<p>I love to travel and enjoy a good trek. During my free time, I like to pick up a book and read (personally, I prefer non-fictional ones) or go cycling. I am currently interested in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marclevoylectures/">physics of photography</a> and I am trying to pick up a thing or two about the art of making short movies.</p>
