<p>What happens when you encounter a snake in an urban environment, say in a city like Chennai? This is a blog detailing the exact sequence of events when my parents encountered a venomous Cobra right at the door step of our house in Chennai.</p>

<p>A vistor to our house was at the gate, when he noticed a snake crawl underneath the car towards the wall. It was a blink or a miss moment and if not for him, the snake would have probably gone unnoticed.</p>

<p>The snake then hid itself in a sump close to the entrance. While it was being watched, the forest department snake catchers in Chennai were contacted. The ranger immediately attended the call and rescued the snake, which was released back in the wild. We think the snake could have come from a small river-cum-sewage that flows behind the house, and where there plenty of rats.</p>

<p>This is a classic example of human-animal conflict and I hope the such calls are handled without harming the snake. Based on this experience, the following are the steps that can be followed when a snake is encountered.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify where the snake is hiding and keep a watch over it to ensure its location. Do not handle or provoke the snake. Snakes prefer to stay away from humans and will not attack unless it cornered or provoked.</li>
  <li>Contact the forest department as soon as possible. In this case, we contacted the Forest Range Office in Chennai at <strong>044-22200335</strong>. The Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Service can also be contacted at <strong>101</strong> for snake rescue (<a href="https://www.tnfrs.tn.gov.in/snake-catching/">Reference</a>).</li>
  <li>Wait till the person arrives and monitor the movement of the snake if it is already moving. It is easier for the snake catcher to catch the animal if the location is known. This reduces time in searching for the snake and less chances of being bitten while searching.</li>
  <li>Last but not the least, do not injure or kill a snake. They are beautiful creatures and keep rat populations at bay. If not for human encroachments or garbage pile up (inviting rats), the snakes would probably mind their own business and go away, reducing the chances of human interactions.</li>
</ol>
