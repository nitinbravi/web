<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarhole_National_Park">Nagarahole National Park</a> is about 250kms from Bangalore city. We learnt that the probability of sighting a tiger within the forest area is generally high during the summer months since animals tend to move across the forest in search of water. Bearing that in mind, Nisha and I decided to drive down to the national park for the long weekend in April 2022.</p>

<p>Needless to mention, we were excited to see the tiger in its natural environment. However, we were aware that it is a game of chance that would require us to take multiple safaris to see the animal.</p>
