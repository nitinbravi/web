<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarhole_National_Park">Nagarahole National Park</a> is about 250kms from Bangalore city. Nisha and I decided to drive down to the national park for the long weekend in April 2022 since we learnt that the probability of sighting a tiger within the forest area is generally high during the summer months since animals tend to move across the forest in search of water.</p>

<p>Needless to mention, we were excited to see the tiger in its natural environment. However, we were aware that it is a game of chance that would require us to take multiple safaris to see the animal. We reached the <a href="http://www.jungleinn.in">Jungle Inn</a> resort on Friday afternoon and post-lunch, we took the bus safari. Although quite uneventful, we managed to see a family of Indian Elephants, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe-necked_mongoose">striped-neck mongoose</a>, peacocks, barking deer, sambar deer, Gaur and a healthy population of chitals (or spotted deer), thanks to the sharp eyes of the driver-cum-forest guide. The safari route is generally around multiple water sources within the forest area.</p>

<p>The next morning, we again took a bus safari hoping that the animals would come out early in the morning. During one such forest trail, a couple of vehicles before us spotted a wild cat, but were unsure if it was a tiger or a leopard. The information travelled fast, and almost all the vehicles including ours rushed to the spot hoping the see the animal. We spent almost half-hour in silence hoping that the animal would make its appearance, but the animal was smart and did not come out of the area and nobody saw the animal. We started to return and along the way, the driver heard a bark of a barking deer followed by a loud growl. Hoping that this is a sign of a carnivore nearby, we again decided to wait hoping that the animal would make its appearance. This again turned out to be a disappointment since the animal did not turn up in the area we were located. So with two near-misses, we realized that luck was not in our favour that morning.</p>

<p>Post breakfast, Nisha and I decided to drive down to Irupu falls which was on the other side of the forest and would require us to drive through the forest area. The thoroughfare is permitted in private vehicles between 6AM-6PM, but nobody is allowed to stop or step out of the vehicle within the forest and the journey between either ends of the forest must be completed within 1 hour failing which a fine is imposed. Although the excitement was palpable, we were very much aware that we were driving through a forest land that belongs to the animals and not the humans.</p>
