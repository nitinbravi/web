<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarhole_National_Park">Nagarahole National Park</a> is about 250kms from Bangalore city. We learnt that the probability of sighting a tiger within the forest area was high during the summer months since animals tend to move across the forest in search of water. Bearing that in mind, Nisha and I decided to drive down to the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve for the long weekend in April 2022. Needless to mention, the excitement to see a tiger in its natural environment was really high and was the objective of the trip.</p>
