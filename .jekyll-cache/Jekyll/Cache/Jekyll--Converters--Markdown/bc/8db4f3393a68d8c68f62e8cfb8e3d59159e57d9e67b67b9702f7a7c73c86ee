<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarhole_National_Park">Nagarahole National Park</a> is about 250kms from Bangalore city. We learnt that the probability of sighting a tiger within the forest area is generally high during the summer months since animals tend to move across the forest in search of water, Nisha and I decided to drive down to the national park for the long weekend in April 2022.</p>

<p>Needless to mention, we were excited to see the tiger in its natural environment. However, we were aware that it is a game of chance that would require us to take multiple safaris to see the animal. We reached the <a href="http://www.jungleinn.in">Jungle Inn</a> resort on Friday afternoon and post-lunch, we took the bus safari. Although quite uneventful, we managed to see a family of Indian Elephants, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe-necked_mongoose">striped-neck mongoose</a>, peacocks, barking deer, sambar deer, Gaur and a healthy population of chitals (or spotted deer), thanks to the sharp eyes of the driver-cum-forest guide.</p>
